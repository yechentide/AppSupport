# Q&A

## What is this app?

This app allows you to edit special data on your iPhone/iPad.  
The targeted data includes a database called LevelDB and a data format called NBT.  
You can access LevelDB and remove any unnecessary data, resulting in a slimmer data set and regenerated chunks.

## What version can be edited with this app?

I have verified version 1.19, so please update to the latest version for any data prior to 1.18.

## Is this app free?

Basic features are free. A Pro version may be offered in the future.
